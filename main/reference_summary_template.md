# Reference Summary Template

**Usage:**
```
@_prompt/reference_summary_template.md
TOPIC = 'Your Topic Here'

The webpages are:
- URL 1
- URL 2
- URL 3
```

---

I want to create a comprehensive summary and guidebook for **{TOPIC}**.

I will ask you to read several webpages and please go through each webpage to summarize all the technical points for me in a comprehensive markdown format documentation.

This documentation is for my future development work, especially for AI agent communication and guidance.

Please make it easier to understand, especially for LLM consumption.

**Requirements:**
- Extract all technical concepts, definitions, and implementation details
- Focus on practical setup steps and configuration examples
- Include code examples and configuration snippets
- Organize information in a logical, easy-to-follow structure
- Optimize for LLM understanding with clear sections and examples
- Include troubleshooting tips and best practices
- Provide references to official documentation or further reading when applicable
- Ensure the output file's save path is `./_ref/{TOPIC}.md`
